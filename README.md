# Automated-CI-CD-Pipeline-for-a-Python-Application
1.⁠ ⁠Project Overview:

	•	Build a Python application (could be a simple web app or microservice).
	•	Set up an automated CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys the application.

2.⁠ ⁠Components:

	•	GitHub Repository for version control.
	•	Docker for containerizing the Python app.
	•	Jenkins or GitHub Actions to manage CI/CD.
	•	Ansible or Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
	•	Kubernetes or a cloud service like gcp for deployment.
	•	Monitoring using app dynamics or elk

3.⁠ ⁠Steps to Follow:

	•	Create a Python Web App: Start with a basic Flask or Django web app.
	•	Dockerize the App: Write a Dockerfile to containerize the Python application.
	•	Automate Testing: Set up unit tests using Python’s unittest or pytest.
	•	Set Up CI: Use Jenkins or GitHub Actions to trigger tests automatically on every commit.
	•	Build a Deployment Script: Use Python or Ansible to automate deployment tasks (starting services, configuring environments, etc.).
	•	Deploy to Kubernetes/AWS: Deploy the containerized app using Kubernetes or to gcp using Terraform or Ansible.
	•	Monitor the App: Integrate a monitoring system to observe performance metrics and application logs.
